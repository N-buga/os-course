1. src/create_idt.c - creates idt with 32 + 16 raws. Timer interrupt is described by 33th raw(32th if we're counting with null).
2. src/initialize_pic.c - initializes interrupt controller.
3. src/initialize_pit.c - initializes interrupt timer.
4. src/initialize_serial.c - initializes uart. Contains also some functions to write in the port.
5. src/inner.c - inner function-handler for timer interrupt. Is called by outer-function.
6. src/main.c - the main file that calls all initializations and set the idtr.
7. src/other_inner.c - inner function-handler for another interrupts. Is called by other_outer-function.
8. src/other_outer.S - function-handler for another interrupts.
9. src/outer.S - function-handler for timer interrupt.
